# Queues are FIFO, like a line at a movie theater, the first person to get in is the first person to get out.

# Stacks are LIFO, like a stack of plates. The last plate to get in is the first plate that gets taken.

# PriorityQueues are like queues except that each element also has a priority. The "Manhattan Queue" is a PriorityQueue that assigns priority based on Manhattan distance (in the future, I may need to make an abstract queue that accepts artibrary heuristics).
